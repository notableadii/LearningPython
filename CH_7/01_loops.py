# what are loops?
# loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times
# for example, if you want to print a message 10 times, you can use a loop

# there are two types of loops in python:
# 1. for loop
# 2. while loop

# for loop example

for i in range(1, 11):  # range(start, end, step)
    print(i)
