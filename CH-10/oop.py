# WHAT IS OOP? 
# OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software.
# Objects can be thought of as self-contained units that contain both data and methods that operate on that data.
# OOP allows for code reusability, modularity, and a clear structure, making it easier to manage and scale complex software systems.
