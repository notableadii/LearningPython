# operators 

# Arithmetic operators 
# arethmatic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers
# arithmetic operators are + - * / // % **


# assignment operators are used to assign values to variables 
# assignment operators are = += += -= *= /= //= %= **=

#comparison operators are used to compare two values
# comparison operators are == != > < >= <= !=

#logical operators are used to combine conditional statements 
# logical operators are "and or not"

# arehtmetic operators

a = 10
b = 20

print("a + b = ", a + b) # addition

# assignment operator

a = 10 - 2 # assigned the value of 10 - 2 to a 
b = 20
b += 2 # increment b by 2 then assign the value to b
b -= 3 # decrement b by 2 then assign the value to b

print("a = ", a) # a = 8
print("b = ", b) # b = 22 when decremented by 3 it will be 19

#comarison operators

d = 5<=4

e = 5!=7 # != not equal to operator

f = 5==5 # == equal to operator here == means that the value of 5 is equal to 5 even though it is not assigned to any variable

print("d = ", d) # d = False
print("e = ", e) # e = True
print("f = ", f) # f = True
